** Synopsis

A simple helpdesk tailored for use in remote-only university exercises:
Students can request help, this will lead to a new request being created,
along with an link to a jitsi-instance that tutors will visit to answer the
students question via webconf.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stack run -- adora-belle -p 8080 -c config.toml
#+END_SRC

This will start an instance listening at port 8080.

Visit =http://localhost:8080/index.html= for the student interface, and
=http://localhost:8080/admin.html= for the admin interface.
Passwords are configured using the file =config.toml=.
The configuration can be updated any time, using the reload button in the
admin interface.
